# Coffee-Sales-Excel-Project

This Excel project challenged me to dive deeper into advanced functions and visualization techniques. This project's goal was to clean, process, visualize and present coffee sales data in a way that made insights very clear and understandable. So I created an user-friendly and interactive Dashboard that visualizes key insights about coffee sales.
Project steps I've done:
1. Data cleaning - checked for duplicates, nulls and blanks.
2. Used XLOOKUP function to bring 4 columns from 'customers' sheet to 'orders' sheet, based on a primary key.
3. Used INDEX and MATCH functions to bring the first 5 columns from 'products' sheet to 'orders' sheet.
4. Used formulas to calculate 'Sales' column and create sales intervals within 'Sales Interval' column
5. Used IFS and IF functions to fill data into 'Coffee Type Names' and 'Roast Type Names'.
6. Changed multiple columns formats for a better understanding.
7. Conditional formatting Sales column
8. Created multiple Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts.
9. Charts and Slicers formatting.
10. Final step: created a Dashboard with various filters to choose from.

The Dashboard I've created can help the business in data-driven decision making by identifying top-performing coffee types, most profitable countries, what are the top buyers in order to analyze their behaviour and how coffee sales evolve over the year.

This project gave me the opportunity to showcase my Excel skills and to create something truly valuable for analyzing sales performance.
